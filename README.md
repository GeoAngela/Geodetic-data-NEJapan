# Geodetic-data-NEJapan
This repository contains minimum norm displacements after earthquake corrections estimated from conventional horizontal geodetic data in NE Japan (Ishikawa and Hashimoto, 1999) from 1894-1984 using the denuisancing method developed by Yu and Segall (1996), and model coordinate velocities utilizing GPS data from 1998. Solutions for "nominal" and "truncated" solutions as defined on Meneses-Gutierrez et al., (2022) "How steady is interseismic crustal deformation in Northeast Japan? Evidence from an integrated analysis of centennial geodetic data" are presented.\
