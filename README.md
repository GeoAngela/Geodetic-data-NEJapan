# Geodetic-data-NEJapan
This repository contains minimum norm displacements with earthquake corrections estimated from conventional horizontal geodetic data (Ishikawa and Hashimoto, 1999) using the denuisancing method developed by Yu and Segall (1996). Solutions for "nominal" and "truncated" solutions as defined on Meneses-Gutierrez et al.  are presented.\
